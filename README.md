Hi, I’m @darmijo15!
I'm a recent grad from Washington State University, where I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Management Information Systems.
I’m working to start a career in Web Development/Software Engineering.
I'm currently learning Front-End Frameworks through freeCodeCamp and working on small Javascript projects along the way.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
